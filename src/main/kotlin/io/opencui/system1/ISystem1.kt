/**
 * It is likely that the users are actually served by two systems: fast and slow.
 * The fast system can take care of many intuitive, automatic thinking that operates quickly and effortlessly.
 * So that builder can focus on more important aspects that needed more deliberation.
 * ISystem1 is used to capture one or more fast system.
 * The implementation, however, does not need to support the energy saving aspects of the system.
 *
 * For now, we assume that all system 1 come with multiple language support.
 * System1 can be smart or dumb, smart system can return empty when it knows it has no good things to say.
 * Dumb system will always return something.
 * For now, we assume the system1 are dumb.
